                <p class="text-justify text-light">Digital is wonderful when it works, but frustrating when it doesn’t. However in a medical
                  emergency this can prove catastrophic.<br />
                  In this situation accessing digital information is too time consuming. In addition its
                  unpredictable nature makes it unreliable in this setting. A small card with all the immediate
                  details needed for medical personnel is the quickest way of knowing the information we need
                  right then.
